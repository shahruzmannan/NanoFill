## Introduction
NanoFill was inspired by the limitations of current autofill solutions in web browsers. Chrome's built-in autofill often fails with newer input field types and lacks adaptability to evolving technologies. NanoFill provides users with a fast, secure, and offline-capable solution that prioritizes privacy while delivering a seamless user experience.

NanoFill replaces Chrome's traditional autofill with a modern, AI-driven approach using Gemini Nano's on-device capabilities. It securely autofills input fields by running locally on the user's device, ensuring no sensitive information is sent to external servers. NanoFill works offline, scales effortlessly, and features a clean, intuitive interface

## Setup
These steps assume that your Chrome is fully up to date, that PromptAPI is still supported in the same way that it was as of December 3, 2024, and that you have not used PromptAPI on this instance of your browser before.
<ol>
<li>Go to <code>chrome://flags</code> and set the flag "Enables optimization guide on device" to <code>Enabled BypassPerfRequirement</code> and the flag "Prompt API for Gemini Nano" to <code>Enabled</code>.</li>
<li>Add the extension to your browser by going to <code>chrome://extensions</code>, turning on developer mode in the top right hand corner, clicking "load unpacked", and then uploading this file's parent directory (assuming you haven't moved it since downloading the repo).</li>
<li>Wait. Though Gemini Nano runs locally, the model still has to be downloaded the first time you use it, so make sure you're connected to internet for this step.</li>
</ol>
